## Introduction

This project involves the creation for a http server using php8.1 docker and swoole-php.

[Following the next tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zaYw5zC3iY)

The only commands that I ran was this:

```bash
docker build -t andreypootmay/swoole_php_example .
docker run -d --name swoole_ejemplo -p "8081:8099" andreypootmay/swoole_php_example
```
